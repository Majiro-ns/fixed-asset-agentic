# Demo Script

> **This file has been consolidated into the main DEMO.md**

For the complete demo script including:
- Timeline and narration scripts
- Operation steps
- Emphasis points
- Recording notes
- Technical setup
- Quick reference

Please see: **[DEMO.md](../DEMO.md)** (project root)

## Why Consolidated?

The demo documentation was previously split between two files:
- `DEMO.md` - Operation steps and technical details
- `docs/demo_script.md` - Narration and recording notes

These have been merged into a single authoritative source (`DEMO.md`) to:
1. Eliminate duplication and potential inconsistencies
2. Provide a single reference for demo preparation
3. Combine operation steps with narration for easier use
